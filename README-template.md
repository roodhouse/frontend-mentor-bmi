## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Styling the radio buttons was the first challenge in this project. I leaned about the appearance and accent-color properties. Also how to require a change on hover, a different change on checked and another different change on checked&hovered. Here is my rather long tailwindcss for an input in this project:

```js
<input name='selection' type="radio" id='metric' value='metric' className='mr-[18px] w-[31px] h-[31px] appearance-none rounded-[50%] border border-solid border-borders checked:bg-blue checked:border-[8px] checked:border-solid checked:border-[#d8e2e7] hover:border-blue checked:hover:bg-blue checked:hover:border-[#d8e2e7]'/>
```
The next challenge that has been difficult is while in tablet view how to keep the image scaled correctly and not sacrifice a piece of the image. I am using object-fit: cover on the image and it scales nicely. However, the rounded edges of the image are not visible. If I allow do not use object-fit: cover then the rounded edges are visible but the image does not scale correctly.
